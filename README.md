# Stripe Usage Record using Swagger Editor

In this exercise, we explore using https://editor.swagger.io/, an API tool, to allow user to create a new subscription usage record for Stripe. For Stripe API documentation reference, see: https://stripe.com/docs/api/usage_records?lang=curl


After creating a test subscription item, fetch the record:

Then create a usage record:

The API is working as expected.
